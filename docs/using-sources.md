# Using Sources

GitDocs has the awesome ability to compose a documentation site from files spread across multiple locations. A source can be a local file, another git repo, or a remote file (support pending.) To use a source, define `source` and `source_type` in the front matter. Once we fetch the source, it will _replace_ the original file that defines the source. For example, let's say our documentation structure looks something like this:

```
docs/
  languages/
    python/
    ruby/
    node.md
```

```yaml
---
# in docs/languages/node.md
source: https://github.com/my-org/node.git
source_type: git
---
```

and `https://github.com/my-org/node` looks something like this:

```
docs/
  installation/
  readme.md
  troubleshooting.md
src/
package.json
```

What will happen when we build this site? GitDocs will clone the Node repo behind the scenes, and replace `docs/languages/node.md` with the contents of the repo's `docs` folder. The result will look something like this:

```
docs/
  languages/
    python/
    ruby/
    node/
      installation/
      readme.md
      troubleshooting.md
```

See how the `node.md` file was replaced by the contents of `node.git/docs/`? You can think of the file as a placeholder for the contents of the source.

## Local Source

You can point to another file in the filesystem and use it as a replacement for the current file.

```yaml
---
source: /a/far/off/file.md
source_type: local
---
```

## Git Source

Using a remote git repo is as easy as pointing to the repo URL (must be public) and defining a branch and root directory where the docs live.

```yaml
---
source: https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git
source_type: git
source_branch: master # this is the default
source_root: docs # this is the default
---
```

## Remote Source

Support for remote source files is currently pending.

## Best Practices

Since external sources cannot be live reloaded, it's best to work on each repo's documentation as a self-contained documentation site and merge into the "main" repo when it is ready to go. This lets you take advantage of the [dev environment](/running-locally).
